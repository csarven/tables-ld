CO2 and other unconventional carbon sources are becoming an attractive raw material and can open new routes for the sustainable production of fine chemicals and high added-value materials. The use of CO2 as material - direct or indirect, e.g. through algae or synthetic biology - opens up new opportunities for creating value on the basis of a waste product from e.g. the energy intensive industry. The field is new and challenging. Even though fundamental research into organometallic chemistry could deliver important insight into potential catalytic cycles, no efficient processes are currently available. A possible research route is to develop new photocatalytic or electrocatalytic routes modelled on natural processes to directly convert CO2 to high added-value chemicals, which can be competitive to current processes, lowering the overall impact on the environment e.g. in terms of greenhouse gases or the synthesis of value-added products in which CO2 remains in the product as a building block. Another option of CO2 recycling is the CO2 fixation by marine and freshwater micro algae and the utilisation of the biomass harvest as energy source or raw material. The intelligent use of algae for the recycling of CO2, coupled with the production of platform chemicals, is a highly innovative approach inspired by the natural processes in the oceans and could provide a basis for worldwide sustainable growth. <span></p></span><span> <p>The research proposals should address the production of valuable fine chemicals starting from CO</span>2 directly (e.g. via new photocatalytic, plasma catalytic or electrocatalytic routes) and/or indirectly (e.g. via algae, but not in competition with more socially or economically valuable productions such as food). The potential contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions should be estimated as well as the cost effectiveness and commercial potential of the innovative technologies. Due to the specific thermodynamic and kinetic boundary conditions, interdisciplinary approaches can be necessary between chemists, biotechnologists, chemical engineers and process engineers. </p> <p>In order to ensure industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners represents added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact. </p>"@en ;

However, many herds/flocks face multi-factorial syndromes, which present major challenges to organic livestock management but also regarding the expectations of consumers and the credibility of organic production. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /><o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\">Thus, strategies for handling diseases appropriately and successfully are urgently needed and could be developed by a combination of learning from existing diversity of organic livestock production systems and testing new innovative forms of prevention and control that support the animal's natural ability to cope with diseases.<o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\">In addition, there is still a considerable need to reduce the input of chemical allopathic treatments in European organic livestock production systems. Neither chemical allopathic nor alternative medicinal treatments have shown a high effectiveness to resolve multi-factorial syndromes.

'Creative industries', as defined in the EC green paper 'Unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries', are those industries which use culture as an input and have a cultural dimension, although their outputs are mainly functional. They include architecture and design, which integrate creative elements into wider processes, as well as subsectors such as graphic design, fashion design or advertising. The economic importance of creative industries has been estimated in terms of employees (almost 6 million in 2004 in EU-25) and in terms of contribution to the GDP (2.6% of the EU-25 GDP).11 <span>The large majority are SMEs (even micro-companies) producing unique products and services. Materials for the creative industry are normally associated to interdisciplinarity in the materials science, design and engineering, responsiveness to cultural and social evolution, addressing breadth and depth of human centred applications. Novel and profitable business areas for the European industry can be searched for, through conceiving, manufacturing and marketing innovative products, processes and services which are which are human-centred, need-driven, design-led and materials-anchored. Examples can be touch-screens, ‘feeling-good materials’ or materials for interior design (at home or office, in the car etc). A great challenge is to conceive a new material at the same time as a new product, thus also defining the appropriate production process and bringing it down the production chain as fast as possible. The advantage of coupling product design with materials development is enormous. A dedicated workshop has recently identified technological and non-technological bottlenecks in the connection materials vs. creative industries; launching dedicated research actions was recommended as well as establishing reinforced relationships between material scientists/engineers and the creative industry professionals/designers. </p></span> <p>Research proposals should develop fully novel smart and functional materials which feature particular properties and functionalities, not solely based on physical parameters, but also embedding aesthetic, sensual, tactile, and cultural properties. Materials scientists and industrial designers should work together in the research. Having scientists involved in the design process is expected to increase the designers' knowledge of the performance potential of materials that could be used and their properties; having designers involved in the materials research is expected to boost a ‘pull’ approach inspiring the conception of novel materials adapted to their industrial use and later on to the commercial success of the future product. Sustainability, environmental impacts and energy efficiency issues must be taken into account and represent an added value of research proposals, which will be taken into account in the evaluations, under the criterion 'Expected impact'. </p>"@en ;

                    "<p>Technical content/scope: The current industrial market is characterised by a turbulent and uncertain demand for highly customised products, of a complexity which is in constant increase. Compared to the past, customers require higher quality, faster delivery times, and shorter times between successive generations of products. Moreover, manufacturers nowadays need to reduce investments in production resources over time and sustainability issues impose that machines are able to efficiently and ecologically support the production of new products without being substituted. All this requires high flexibility and permanent adaptation of machines, process equipment and production systems to any changes in products and in process evolution.</p> <p>The reliability and availability of machines, equipment and production systems are paramount for efficient production. The key goal is to have maximum availability of machinery, producing high-quality parts with almost zero-defects and in-specification materials at highest production rates. As an example, mechatronic strategies based on adaptronic systems or intelligent materials can compensate deviations from initial accuracy requirements detected by the continuous monitoring and control systems.</p> <p>Research activities should focus on new high performance manufacturing technologies in terms of efficiency (volumes, speed, process capability), flexibility, robustness and accuracy based on new system architectures with self-adaptive machine structures and on mechatronic modules, multi-layer controls and highly redundant measurement, sensing and actuator structures. These R&amp;D lines should lead to new equipment, lean and smart machines and production systems which are capable of taking into account tacit knowledge from operators and require less shop-floor space, by means of reduction of peripherals, reduction of system complexity, optimisation of cycles and process planning.</p> <p>The aim is to allow improvements through successive investments in production equipment using flexible technologies such as modular production units. Furthermore, the new solutions should bring the integration of the necessary ICT support providing simplification and real user friendliness.</p> <p>In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners, including SMEs, represents an added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact.</p> <p>The proposals should cover both research and demonstration activities. Prototypes and pilot implementations in real industrial settings represent a clear added-value. Whilst there is no lower or upper limit on the requested EU contribution, the target is that proposals allocate around 50% of the total eligible costs of the project (excluding management costs) to demonstration activities and this objective will be taken into account in the evaluation under the criteria S/T Excellence and Impact. </p>"@en ;

Work will continue throughout 2011, accounting also for the needs of the newly-created European External Action Service (EEAS). Prioritisation of actions will follow.</p> <p>The potential application areas identified so far under SEA include support to peace-keeping operations, intelligence for humanitarian-aid operations, border monitoring outside the EU, treaty monitoring and nuclear non-proliferation, assessment of security risks related to urban resilience, food security, water management, illegal exploration of natural resources or monitoring of illicit crops.</p> <p>Capacities have been developed in FP7 projects, providing a baseline for operational capabilities in Europe. To prepare operational services, these technical capabilities need to be brought to a pre-operational status. In particular, lessons learned from projects such as GMOSAIC and LIMES (FP7), GMOSS and TANGO (FP6) and other stakeholders' experience (e.g. National, EUSC, EUMETSAT, JRC …) have been used in the technology analysis subjacent to SEA scenarios, in particular regarding the availability and suitability of technology to respond to user needs.</p> <p>Existing capabilities are to be further enhanced through research and development focussing on specific research gaps identified.

The work should clearly engage users and address how the results can lead to operational services. An objective to be included is the definition of the specifications of corresponding potential services for 2014 onwards.</p> <p>Proposals should take into account the developments made in previous GMES projects, especially those on a security and related emergency context, and be synergetic to the other activities supported by GMES research or initial operations funding. . Particular emphasis should be placed on a harmonised set of operational services for Emergency/Crisis management, optimising data procurement and processing capacities, while facilitating service provision to different user communities, without unnecessary duplication. Synergies with Land, Marine and possibly Atmosphere services should also be fully explored (ie. using data from those services to derive added-value information for security applications, without duplication).</p> <p>For each of the scenarios, the project should also include, where relevant, an analysis of the benefits based on potential synergies between defence and civil infrastructure and applications, as well as service evolution expectations based on technology evolution, in particular those related to the space segment.</p> <p>Note: Limits on the EU financial contribution apply.

                    "<p>Technical content/scope: 'Plug-and-Produce' is a coveted feature for the realisation of increasingly agile manufacturing systems in a globalised industry that demands continuous change of processes, products and production volumes. This feature should allow the automatic configuration and seamless integration of heterogeneous devices in(to) a system. The so-called smart factories are meant to be production sites featuring higher levels of (cost- and time-) efficiency, productivity and re-configurability. A successful realisation of this paradigm requests the incorporation of the latest developments in automation, control, mechatronics, ICT technologies, human-machine interaction, optimisation techniques, strategic planning and smart robotics. Moreover, the further integration of any newly developed technologies into the production lines and the industrial environments requires complementary research and innovation efforts.</p> <p>'Plug-and-Produce' devices allowing the adaptive connection of automation equipment would need to focus on concepts and solutions in the fields of advanced agent-oriented software and service-oriented architecture middleware that pave the way for the actualisation of smart factories compliant to the 'plug-and-produce' principles. Some instances of the outcome of the research might be results in configuration modules, communication protocols, discovery -and retrieval of abilities- and negotiation protocols and tools, end-user interfaces. The incorporation of extensions guaranteeing interoperability and harmonised cooperation among intelligent manufacturing components whilst yielding enhanced fault-tolerance and self-configuration skills at system level shall be welcome.</p> <p>Future smart factories are meant to increasingly comprise, probably heterogeneous, intelligent machine-tools, automation equipment, peripheral devices, robots and actuators, smart sensors and industrial IT systems, including safety-oriented systems.</p> <p>Research is needed on concepts or solutions for such manufacturing systems that guarantees interoperability. Research should focus on several of the following areas:<br>- Scalable extension of the system capabilities through addition of new components;<br>- Reconfiguration of the system functionality whenever new components are brought <br>   into it;<br>- Reuse of manufacturing equipments on all levels;<br>- Migration and transition of the manufacturing systems to modern architectures (e.g. service oriented architectures) with the objective to reduce commissioning effort or ramp-up time);<br>- Customisation of products by flexible manufacturing.</p> <p>All these features should be enabled in a seamless and user-friendly manner such that all the intelligent, but probably heterogeneous, elements in the ensuing system can still successfully operate in a cooperative manner, which exploits the full potential of the installed components in a safe and ergonomically designed working environment.</p> <p>In order to ensure an efficient implementation and maximum impact of SME-related activities, the leading role of SMEs with R&amp;D capacities will be evaluated under the criteria 'Implementation' and 'Impact': the coordinator does not need to be an SME but the participating SMEs should have the decision making power in the project management; and the output should be for the benefit of the participating SMEs and the targeted SME dominated industrial communities.</p> <p><em>This topic is complementary to topic FoF-ICT-2011.7.1(b), which deals with large-scale validation of advanced industrial robotics systems.</em></p>"@en ;

Proposals could also address assessment of effectiveness of recovery or reconstruction efforts by change detection analysis based on satellite imagery.

They should also stimulate coordination or cross-border cooperation between countries (e.g. by creating thematic or regional R&amp;D clusters). Cross-cutting dimensions between GMES services should also be enhanced (e.g. by fostering complementarities between land and emergency management services).

                    "The Security Research Theme aims to promote further cooperation between public authorities<br>for getting new solutions developed to improve the quality and efficiency of public services<br>related to security, on topics of common European interest, through the pre-operational<br>validation (POV) of such services. Pre-operational validation guided by potential end-users<br>allows a tangible assessment of the performance levels offered by innovative technologies in a<br>realistic user-defined operational scenario, where a trade off between efficiency, effectiveness<br>and cost can be aligned with actual needs. Moreover, pre-operational validation allows, not<br>only the assessment of a stand-alone technology, but also the assessment of the integration of<br>the new capabilities provided into current surveillance infrastructure at all levels in the<br>systems’ lifecycle (from technical to logistics, training, maintenance, operation and<br>disengagement).<br>The close link between end-users and industry, especially in those cases where there is a<br>fuzzy perception of the real needs of the user in daily practise for a particular technology, will<br>extend the benefits of pre-operational validation beyond technical development. The<br>identification of innovative applications, business models and procurement strategies will<br>reverberate in the integration of innovative solutions as fully operational tool. By acting as<br>technologically knowledgeable validator of new R&amp;D, the public demand side can drive<br>innovation.<br>Last but not least, the activities carried out under pre-operational validation shall put in<br>common, in an experimental framework, the achievements of previous initiatives that have<br>explored and studied the different dimensions of components and systems, from the pure<br>technological development to the features of its exploitation.<br>In particular, as part of Activity 10.3 (Intelligent Surveillance and enhancing Border<br>Security), this topic is presented for proposals to enhance the use by the concerned civilian<br>authorities of innovative technology for border surveillance.26 The specific objective of this<br>topic is to address solutions for the pre-operational validation of \"Common Application of<br>Surveillance Tools at EU level\".<br>The overall objective is to provide the EU with an operational and technical framework that<br>would increase situational awareness and improve the reaction capability of authorities<br>surveying the external borders of the EU. A decentralised approach should be followed with national key players in its implementation. Only selected elements of a European approach to<br>Border Surveillance are to be done at European level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.<br>New security solutions to be validated under this action should take into account any aspect of<br>border security that could threaten human rights or break international law. When necessary<br>and appropriate, alternative solutions should also be explored.<br>The topic proposed is to be implemented via the CP-CSA funding instrument, which involves<br>a combination of the collaborative project and coordination and support action funding<br>schemes. It enables therefore the financing, under the same grant agreement, of research,<br>coordination and support activities.<br>Its aim is to both enable public authorities in charge of border surveillance to innovate faster<br>in the provision of their institutional services, making them more efficient and effective, and<br>also increase the research capacity and innovation performance of European companies and<br>research institutions, creating new opportunities to take international leadership in new<br>markets.<br>This CP-CSA for POV will combine two components with synergistic effects:<br>a. Networking and coordination activities: for public bodies in Europe to cooperate in the<br>innovation of their public services through a strategy that includes POV.<br>b. Joint research activities: related to validating the POV strategy jointly defined by the public<br>bodies participating in the action. This would include the exploration of possible solutions<br>for the targeted improvements in border surveillance services, and the testing of these<br>solutions against a set of jointly defined concepts of operations and performance criteria.<br>This activity requires the participation of at least three independent public authorities in<br>charge of border surveillance (at local, regional, national or supra-national levels), each<br>established in a different Member or Associated State. Other stakeholders may participate in<br>addition, if their participation is well justified and adds value to the action (especially if they<br>represent an authority or a regulatory body with responsibility in some area affected by the<br>use of a particular technology).<br>SCOPE of the CP-CSA (Collaborative Project and Coordination and Support Action)<br>In the context of European Border Surveillance, this CP-CSA is to conduct pre-operational<br>validation of common applications of surveillance tools at EU level via the competitive<br>testing and assessment of several potential solutions. Tools to be tested may include a variety<br>of platform types deploying sensors for surveillance purposes.<br>The information acquired by each platform type should be correlated with ship reporting<br>systems and other available intelligence sources (i.e. satellite imagery, sensor data or open<br>source information) to provide the relevant national and European Agencies with surveillance<br>information on their external borders and the EU pre-frontier area on a frequent, reliable and<br>cost-efficient basis.<br>The specific objective of the competitive testing will be to assess:<br>· the identification of the different technological alternatives for the achievement of a set<br>of user-defined operational objectives;<br>· the technical feasibility of alternative options for the Common Applications of different<br>types of surveillance tools;<br>· the feasibility of the integration of these technologies taking into consideration the<br>limitations imposed by the existing surveillance deployments and the current use of<br>segregated and non segregated airspace;<br>· the comparative performance of proposed options, while deployed in daily operations in<br>real scenarios;<br>· the identification and documentation, as appropriate, of the infrastructure, capabilities<br>and skills required for the acquisition and operation of these systems under user-defined<br>safety and security conditions;<br>· the cost-benefit ratio of each of the options tested within each of the two types of tools;<br>· the identification of the maturity level showed by both solutions in order to promote<br>short/mid term utilisation;<br>· the definition of innovative applications, business models and procurement schemes that<br>can facilitate the migration to these new solutions from the existing traditional tools.<br>The overall validation action CP-CSA is to be divided in the following three phases.<br>1) Initial Definition Phase (CSA):<br>The definition phase should be based on the latest relevant requirements for European Border<br>Surveillance. Participating border surveillance Authorities are expected to present their<br>cooperative plan for definition of the later phases, in coordination with other relevant EU<br>organizations.<br>In this phase a strategy shall be put in place for:<br>- Identification of elements requiring new R&amp;D that could be tested and validated in<br>cooperation,<br>- Definition of an action plan, setting scenarios and issues for concrete implementation of<br>activities,<br>- Establishment of good practice procedures for POV evaluation and monitoring (common<br>evaluation criteria and implementation methods),<br>- Drafting a preliminary IPR strategy for the (expected) outcome of the Call for Tender in<br>phase 2, taking into account the provisions set out in the Appendix,<br>- Allocation and training of additional resources for implementation (if appropriate),<br>- Building cooperation with other stakeholders (if appropriate).<br>The outcome is expected to be a Validation Strategy Document, including a practical Exercise<br>Plan for the actual testing phase, to be used for the definition of the specifications of a joint<br>POV Call for Tender for the subsequent execution phase, setting the rules for participation,<br>the criteria to evaluate competitive tenders, and for selection/award. Such call shall be defined<br>in such a way that it respects the Treaty principles and the specific requirements in Appendix.<br>2) Preparatory Work and Execution Phase (CP):<br>This phase will implement the strategy and action plan as prescribed by the participating<br>authorities, in Phase 1 (in particular the Call for Tender for the implementation of testing). In<br>this phase the providers of solutions to be tested (at least two for each scenario), are to be selected via the competitive call as defined in phase 1. These providers will execute the<br>testing of their systems according to the prescription of the action plan, working under the<br>supervision of the concerned national Border Authorities. The testing Exercise Plan is<br>expected to be contracted along 2013-2014.<br>3) Final Ex-post Assessment Phase (CSA):<br>In this phase, which will conclude the overall validation, participating national Border<br>Authorities, in coordination with other relevant EU organizations, will conduct a thorough<br>assessment of the solution performances as demonstrated in the testing exercises of phase 2,<br>against the set of jointly defined performance criteria, in order to verify fitness for purpose,<br>with a view to a potential conversion into permanent services of the systems tested. This<br>phase should confirm as appropriate the IPR strategy and include dissemination of results to<br>standardisation bodies (if appropriate). This ex-post assessment of the outcome of each<br>scenario is to be implemented in the first half of 2015.<br>For implementing this CP-CSA, different constellations for joint validation are allowed,<br>such as for example common validation entity, lead authority and piggy-backing<br>constellations."@en ;

This shall include the intention to select multiple companies to start the<br>pre-operational validation in parallel, as well as the number of phases and the expected<br>duration of each phase.<br>Functional specifications shall be used in order to formulate the object of the POV tender<br>as a problem to be solved without prescribing a specific solution approach to be followed.<br>· In view of triggering tenderers to send in innovative offers that include R&amp;D that can<br>bring breakthrough improvements to the quality and efficiency of public services, the<br>selection of offers shall not be based on lowest price only. The POV contracts shall be<br>awarded to the tenders offering best value for money, that is to say, to the tender offering<br>the best price-quality ratio, while taking care to avoid any conflict of interests.<br>· In respect of the Treaty principles the public purchasers shall ensure EU wide publication<br>for the POV call for tender in at least English and shall evaluate all offers according to<br>the same objective criteria regardless of the geographic location of company head offices,<br>company size or governance structure. The POV process should be organised so as to<br>stimulate companies to locate a relevant portion of the R&amp;D and operational activities<br>related to the POV contract in the European Economic Area or a country having<br>concluded a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.<br>· In POV, the public validator does not reserve the R&amp;D results exclusively for its own use.<br>To ensure that such an arrangement is beneficial both for the public purchaser and for the<br>companies involved in POV, R&amp;D risks and benefits are shared between them in such a<br>way that both parties have an incentive to pursue wide commercialisation and take up of<br>the new solutions. Therefore, for POV, ownership rights of IPRs generated by a company<br>during the POV contract should be assigned to that company. The public authorities<br>directly contributing to the POV phase (2) should be assigned a free licence to use the<br>R&amp;D results for internal use as well as the right to require participating companies to<br>license IPRs to third parties under fair and reasonable market conditions, to be specified in<br>the Call for Tender. A call-back provision should ensure that IPRs from companies that do<br>not succeed to exploit the IPRs themselves within a given period after the POV project<br>return back to the public bodies in charge of border surveillance.<br>· In order to enable the public validators to establish the correct (best value for money)<br>market price for the R&amp;D service, in which case the presence of State aid can in<br>principle be excluded according to the definition contained in Article 107 of the Treaty<br>on the Functioning of the European Union, the distribution of rights and obligations<br>between public validators and companies participating in the POV, including the<br>allocation of IPRs, shall be published upfront in the POV call for tender documents and<br>the POV call for tender shall be carried out in a competitive and transparent way in line<br>with the Treaty principles which leads to a price according to market conditions, and does<br>not involve any indication of manipulation. The consortium of public purchasers should<br>ensure that the POV contracts with participating companies contain a financial<br>compensation according to market conditions compared to exclusive development price<br>for assigning IPR ownership rights to participating companies, in order for the POV call<br>for tender not to involve State aid.<br>· The POV contract that will be concluded with each selected organisation shall take the<br>form of one single framework contract covering all the POV phases, in which the distribution of rights and obligations of the parties is published upfront in the tender<br>documents and which does not involve contract renegotiations on rights and obligations<br>taking place after the choice of participating organisations. This framework contract shall<br>contain an agreement on the future procedure for implementing the different phases<br>(through specific contracts), including the format of the intermediate evaluations after the<br>solution design and prototype development stages that progressively select organisations<br>with the best competing solutions."@en .

                    "The challenge <br> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The concept of European Union citizenship lies at the heart of the EU’s unique polity. The way in which citizens perceive and exercise it is inherently connected with the development and implementation of all EU policies, and reflects the development of the EU political project as a space of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights. </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is therefore very important to understand EU citizens’ ways of interacting and engaging in the public space across all Member States so as to develop the EU's democratic strength. Significant developments in EU law, jurisprudence and institutional settings that have taken place over recent years, as well as the specificities of Union citizenship as the only form of supranational citizenship, require further, encompassing analysis of the factors that help or hinder EU citizens’ awareness of their rights and obligations in all Member States, and their exercise of those rights whether they live within or outside the EU.</p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Why it matters for Europe</p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">European Union citizenship has always ranked high among European priorities. This is even more the case in a landscape marked by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty which introduced the new European citizens’ initiative, reinforced the role of the European Court of Justice, and made the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. The appointment of a European Commissioner in charge of ‘Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship’, and the adoption of the Stockholm Programme for ‘An open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens’ have also contributed o a renewed emphasis on citizens' rights. </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">The EU Citizenship Report 2010, recent polls and survey studies consistently point out that EU citizenship rights are often underused. Many EU citizens are not fully aware of what rights and duties their EU citizenship entails. Even when they are aware of them, they may find it difficult to exercise them in many respects. Furthermore, the low voter turnout in European elections also points to the need to foster reflection about the reasons for what has been seen as a democratic gap and to design new ways of encouraging citizens, including younger people, to take part in active democracy. </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">While the EU has funded research on citizenship since its 5th research Framework Programme, these persistent gaps still need to be addressed. In view of recent political and legal developments, new analytical and empirical challenges have to be considered. </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Addressing the challenge</p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Interdisciplinary research should engage in broad, systematic reflection on the current status and practices of EU citizenship. The analysis should include a historical dimension, and aim to identify what added value EU citizenship offers  and how it can deploy its full potential in facilitating citizens’ daily life. The research should include the articulation of EU citizenship with national citizenship, and the rules on acquisition and loss of those citizenships for both non-EU nationals and EU citizens alike. Accordingly, it should focus on rights in Art. 20 TFEU, such as freedom of movement, consular protection, and political participation, but also go beyond these and look into issues affecting citizens’ rights in a broader perspective, including, for instance, issues of mutual recognition in the field of civil justice, family law, social security.  </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">Research dimensions to be taken into consideration:</p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Provide a comparative overview and classification of the main shortcomings related to the exercise of EU citizens’ rights and obligations in all 27 EU Member States and possibly candidate countries. They should identify the grounds for these, including, for instance, persistent differences in legal and judicial systems, diverging conceptions of the welfare state and socio-economic systems, immigration and integration laws and policies in the Member States, diverse cultural models, and historical traditions. When relevant and building on past and ongoing EU level research, analysis should also take into account the specific needs and status of EU citizens residing outside the EU, as well as access of non-EU nationals to Member State nationality and EU citizenship, and of EU citizens to the nationality of the host state in cases where they live outside the EU. </p> <p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Analyse how and to what extent these shortcomings can be overcome, and the main challenges ahead for EU institutions and Member States in this process. Research should be forward-looking and take into account possible further expansion in the notion of EU citizenship through EU law and jurisprudence, for instance, by looking at how fundamental rights contribute to shaping EU citizenship; its linkages with Member States’ competence on acquisition and loss of national citizenship, its connections with the right to free movement under EU law; future ways of implementing art. 25 TFEU by strengthening or adding new rights to those currently enshrined in art. 20(2) TFEU, or more. In this respect, future developments in Lisbon Treaty provisions addressing the involvement of citizens in policy making, such as the European Citizens’ Initiative, and regulating space for dialogue with representative associations and civil society could be analysed. </p> <br> As men and women may perceive and exercise citizenship rights in different ways, both at EU and national level, a gender dimension should be taken into account in all of the above. Furthermore, a comparative investigation of developments in other federal-like contexts could be pursued, as, for instance, in Canada, the USA or India."@en ;

The European Commission has adopted a new integrated strategy which sets out targeted measures to secure and improve access to raw materials for the EU (Communication on raw materials COM(2008)699 and accompanying Commission Staff Working Paper SEC(2008)2741 of 4 November 2008). The ad-hoc group of the Raw Materials Supply Group has issued a report containing policy-oriented recommendations to secure access to critical raw materials and to enhance its efficient use (Critical raw materials for the EU – Report of the Ad-hoc Working Group on defining critical raw materials17). Amongst other actions, the report recommends: (i) to improve the availability of reliable, consistent information in relation to raw materials; encouraged more research into life-cycle assessments for raw materials and their products on a 'cradle-to-grave' basis; (ii) to create a working group(s) to further analyse the impact of emerging technologies on demand of raw materials; and (iii) to engage in policy actions to make recycling of raw materials or raw material-containing products more efficient, including the promotion of research on system optimisation and recycling of technically-challenging products and substances, according to an appropriate LCA approach. The report also recommends that substitution should be encouraged, notably by promoting research on substitutes for critical raw materials in different applications and to increase opportunities under EU RTD Framework Programmes.</p> <p>The proposed support action should network interested stakeholders, in order to create a pole of competence on the emerging field of the substitution of critical raw materials. It should identify and propose initiatives to help to address relevant EU policies effectively, and also address the specificities of this area such as its industrial, environmental, economic and geopolitical aspects. During its life, the action should collect and elaborate data and make available to the EU Institutions and Member States accurate pictures, analysis of needs, threats and opportunities and proposals for further action. A roadmap of actions, actors and timing, including mapping and networking of existing national activities and/or centres should be developed. During negotiations, complementarity will be ensured with work performed in response to topic GC.SST.2012.1-3, 'European strategy for rare materials and their possible substitution'. </p>"@en ;

                    "<span> <p>Technical content/scope</span>: The photocatalyst-based destruction of noxious organic compounds in air, water or soil is a versatile and clean technology, which can be applied to the treatment of a large variety of chemicals, including not fully biodegradable or toxic compounds. This technological approach appears extremely promising for the recovery of polluted media in industrial environments or in difficult to reach areas such as e.g. in the case </p> <p>of accidental oil spills in remote zones, as unfortunately witnessed in the recent past. Successful and timely intervention can indeed avoid major damages to people, the environment and the economy. Furthermore, remote areas may lack power supplies so that the possibility of using solar light or other naturally available energy would be advantageous. As a non-binding example, nanostructured photoactive films can be mentioned to improve light harvesting and charge separation, and to extend the photoactivity into the visible light region by altering the band structure of the materials, as well as to develop improved photoreactor units using solar light. </p> <p>The research proposals should unite EU and ASEAN researchers around the common goal of generating new knowledge on photocatalytic materials and processes, and delivering improved ways to enhance the efficiency. Reaction temperatures are critical and photocatalysis should take place at normal environment temperatures. Cooperation of scientists from different fields is welcome in order to profit from innovative inter-disciplinary or 'converging' approaches.</p> <p><em>This topic is complementary to other topics in Theme 4, NMP and Theme 2, FAFB, which deal with groundwater (‘Reactive nanoparticles for in-situ site remediation’) and oil-spill remediation (‘Innovative biotechnologies for tackling oil spill disasters’).</em></p><em sizset=\"1\" sizcache=\"12\"></em>"@en ;

Ship reporting systems (mainly LRIT,<br>VMS and AIS) are today the backbone of maritime surveillance, control, safety and security.<br>However their contents can be faked (spoofed) by malevolent operators. Research is needed<br>into techniques to verify the sources of these messages, for instance by reception and analysis<br>of the emitted radio signals or fusing with intrinsic vessel properties data (magnetic and/or<br>acoustic signatures; dimensions). This should also take into account the use of ship navigation<br>radar for ship detection and tracking. Space-based sensors could be used as a complement (not<br>exclusively).<br>Recent and ongoing developments in the EU are aimed at strengthening maritime<br>surveillance, because of perceived threats to the security of the maritime domain. Maritime<br>domain awareness is achieved by combining vessel traffic information from many sources,<br>both cooperative (reporting) and non-cooperative (observation).<br>However, the data of the reporting systems is taken currently for the most part at face value.<br>As soon as the maritime domain awareness is operational on the above principles, malvolent<br>operators could take counter-measures. One likely and powerful counter-measure is spoofing<br>the vessel reporting systems. Spoofing (i.e., wilfully transmitting false information) is already<br>occurring now in particular and still rare situations. Therefore, the authorities in the EU, at<br>MS and EU-level, need to be ahead of this potential security hole by evolving counterspoofing<br>methods.

Climate-energy-economy models are fundamental tools to evaluate mitigation strategies, assessing the costs and inform decision makers. However, currently available tools have relevant limitations such as the difficulty to represent pervasive technological developments, the difficulty to represent non-linearities, thresholds and irreversibility, and the insufficiently developed representation of economic sectors with a significant potential for mitigation and resource efficiency. Research should focus on the development and validation of new models, new model components or in the improvement/upgrading of existing models. Economic impacts of implemented and planned mitigation policies in the EU and beyond should be assessed at different scales and for the key economic sectors. Transparency in the description of the models' functioning, of their strengths and limitations is requested with a view to unequivocally frame the relevant area of application of each model and hence to improve users confidence in the results.

Current industrial processes for nanofabrication rely mainly on deterministic top-down processes using techniques such as photolithography. However, the fundamental limits of top-down miniaturisation are approaching, not to mention the typical high investment costs of the manufacturing 'fabs'. </p> <p>Building nano-devices, assemblies and architectures through development of 'bottom-up' approaches represents a unique possibility to develop radically new bottom-up concepts towards mass fabrication of the next generation of complex nanotechnology products, including electronics, sensing applications, medicine and multiple other applications that requires hierarchical assembly. These processes should be capable of integrating a high number - potentially billions - of nanoscale building blocks with disparate functions. Hence, a massively parallel assembly approach capable of producing higher order structures with designed properties at industrially relevant scales is required and is the primary aim of this topic. </p> <p>The focus of the topic is the development of viable and cost effective processes for the assembly of nanoscale building blocks into useful macroscopic devices and products. The proposals should address:<br>- Organisation and integration of heterogeneous components of different sizes and compositions into higher level structures and devices. Components may include biomolecules, organic molecules and inorganic nanostructures. <br>- Design principles and new control methods for tunable dimension, structure and property complexity. <br>- Control and scalability of the process, including quality aspects, as required by the specific application. </p> <p>The proposals should be application driven and tunability, control and scalability be demonstrated in a laboratory environment. In addition, the project work should include the preparation of a roadmap detailing further development needs for industrial deployment of the developed technology. The process design should aim at inherent safety and EHS assessment from life-cycle perspective must be included. </p> <p>In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners represents an added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact. </p>"@en ;

In Europe, the controversy focuses on the<br>regulatory scheme with which the EU attempts to address seemingly new forms of terrorism.<br>Anti-terrorism policies respond to real threats, but also to perceived needs for action. New<br>legislation purporting to combat terrorism is frequently legitimated by a reference to the<br>improvement of security for the citizen. However, it is often not clear, from a sociological<br>perspective, whether the legislation in question is effective at all, calling, from a legal point of<br>view, into question the proportionality of the given measure.<br>Moreover, new counter-terrorism policies have led to legislation that often departs from<br>traditional patterns, such as the clear distinction between prevention and punishment. It is<br>very difficult to define in precise legal terms when a preventive measure based on an actuarial<br>risk-assessment is legally required or permitted. If the risk is considered complex and the<br>potential damage substantial, the line between legitimate intervention and the illegitimate<br>intrusion in the citizens' rights are not easy to draw.<br>o The aim is to integrate sociological and legal research on the legitimacy and efficiency<br>of counter-terrorism measures on a European level and on the level of the Member<br>states with research in the field of security studies that often neglects social and legal<br>aspects of counter-terrorism measures. The following questions should be examined:<br>Comparatively, how have European anti-terrorism measures been transposed into<br>legislation in the Member States?

For many of these industries the price of fuel is a major component of overall operating costs and the temperature <em>per se </em>may well influence the environmental performance of industrial processes. Materials that allow operation at high temperature are essential for sustainable industrial competitiveness because the efficiency of fuel conversion and use is related to the operating temperature. For instance, power plants operating at temperatures higher than 615 °C are usually not constructed, because of the limitations imposed by the materials used for making the tubes, drums, and pipes which contain and transport the steam; another limitation relates to the materials needed for high temperature sensors used for structure monitoring in power generation. The efficiency of power plants using such concepts is expected to improve as a result of the significant increase of the working temperature. </p> <p>The research proposals should target radical improvements of materials' in-service properties, such as corrosion resistance, erosion resistance, radiation resistance, reliability and durability, ionic conductivity and mechanical properties. Design studies should also be performed when necessary in order to investigate the potential of reductions in the use of expensive materials so as to make the concept as economically attractive as possible. The materials concepts proposed should be cost effective, easy for fabrication, construction, monitoring and control. Environmental and safety issues should be addressed as appropriate. Attention should also be paid to the life cycle analysis of the new solutions in comparison to the ones currently used. Modelling as an ancillary activity for improving and optimising design and for producing cost effective predictive tools could be included, as well as specific sensors to ensure monitoring and enable in-service control. Emphasis should be given to material behaviour modelling and structural integrity analysis under extremely severe operating conditions (e.g. creep, fatigue, thermal-mechanical fatigue, oxidation and their interactions, at high service temperatures). Standardisation and/or the production of (certified) reference materials may also be addressed as an integrated part of the research proposal as well as appropriate novel inspection technologies and methods that might be required. </p> <p>In order to ensure industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners represents an added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact. </p>"@en ;

This challenge can be tackled by designing in an integrated manner adaptive production systems for eco-efficient processes and systems, using the information of sensors and in-process measurement methods. A suitable energy efficiency performance measuring system would help fulfilling customer needs with the minimum possible use of energy and material resources. This control system needs to focus on concepts which facilitate the evaluation, control and improvement of energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. Firstly, an energy performance measurement system at European or global level with suitable and measurable energy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) has to be developed, utilising new sensors and visual systems for in-process measurement as enablers. Secondly, concepts for evaluating this KPI related information have to be developed, followed by decision support, i.e. which control mechanisms and improvement measures have to be implemented on the basis of this information. With the development of such concepts, factories would know their energy performance in real-time, facilitating more effective business decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information.</p> <p>Research activities should address all of the following areas:<br>- Environment-conscious, life cycle and holistic process-machine approaches, to minimise the overall impact of production systems and to produce added-value products with minimised consumption of resources and process emissions.<br>- The definition of effective (specific and quantitatively measureable) Energy KPIs as well as the visualisation of these KPIs, together with the development of conceptual frameworks and software to measure and evaluate Energy-KPIs.<br>- Technologies capable of harvesting and recovering portions of the energy involved in the production processes, both at machine and at a system level, as well as in the plant environment.</p> <p>In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners, including SMEs, represents an added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact.

                    "The Europe 2020 Strategy recognises the role of education for smart and inclusive growth. It<br>aims to reduce the proportion of young people dropping out of school to 10%, and to raise the proportion of those with tertiary education to at least 40 %. The flagship initiative ‘Innovation<br>Union’ acknowledges that the EU and Member States need to continue to invest in education<br>and to modernise education systems at all levels so as to raise skills and prepare young people<br>to meet the challenges of innovation.<br><br>The problems in educational systems are widely shared and urgently need addressing in all<br>European countries. Traditional schooling has mainly been about teaching and testing,<br>producing knowledge and skills for an industrial society of a type which is now in rapid<br>decline. Examples of innovative approaches are widespread. However, many education<br>systems still face difficulties in providing competencies that ensure excellence in a global<br>context as well as reinforcing social cohesion and individual development. They are criticised<br>for being too traditional in their understanding and development of education, and for failing<br>to adapt to the new socio-economic and civic challenges, as the 19th and 20th centuries task<br>of nation-building through education is not as pervasive as it was. For some time now,<br>education systems have appeared ineffective at providing education to the masses, that is,<br>making quality education available to all. They have a role to play in countering the<br>persistence of socio-economic inequalities and the skills mismatch, and in addressing the<br>emergence of new competences, attitudes and behaviours, the need to develop entrepreneurial<br>skills, and in furthering new forms of personal development and modern expressions of social<br>cohesion. Moreover, biological factors could also be taken into account if they help account<br>for differences in learning ability between individuals.<br><br>Education systems are in fact key to the fulfilment of people and to the social and political<br>integration of individuals in their society. In other words, they are there to provide,<br>accompany or even mould a whole array of attitudes, behaviours, values and skills that are<br>socially and politically viable in modern society and that no other social institution or group<br>(e.g. the family, local group or social class, faith-based community) can provide. At the same<br>time, societies at large increasingly favour forms of open education with less collective<br>indoctrination and more support for individual or looser group aspirations. The decisive role<br>of education is recognised even at pre-school level.<br><br>This leads to harsh questions as to how education systems can simultaneously provide<br>excellence, more social and civic cohesion, and enable personal development, including<br>capacities for creativity. In such a context, paths to innovation and reform of education<br>systems should be systematically explored, taking into account the capacities of all actors in<br>education systems to change the institutional dynamics of education. Changing the<br>fragmented, colossal European education systems requires significant, long-term efforts and<br>the commitment of all stakeholders at all levels.<br><br>This Challenge covers all relevant aspects of education, including pedagogy and new ways of<br>learning (including insights from neurosciences if applicable), curricula, assessment of pupils<br>and students, infrastructure, recruitment, training and careers, gender, minorities, educators,<br>the involvement of parents, children and young people, the role of national, regional or local<br>administrations and of all other actors in society in need of strong educational achievements<br>in all fields.<br><br>Why it matters for Europe<br>Debate has now raged for years in all countries as to how schools could help shape society<br>and its future citizens (beyond purely economic concerns). The European Union has been active in proposing modernisation and convergence of national education systems, while<br>respecting Member States’ autonomous powers of decision. It has, in particular, offered<br>coordination and several EU programmes and initiatives (e.g. Socrates, Lifelong Learning,<br>New Skills for New Jobs). In this framework, comparisons and exchanges of experience<br>between countries have to some degree contributed to fostering a review of policies for<br>education in a national and European setting.<br><br>However, much remains to be done in the area of policy for education. The challenge for the<br>EU is to unleash the potential of its young people and to give them the means to develop and<br>define their future in Europe. Reforming education systems to tackle the challenges of the 21st<br>century should integrate all the political, cultural, social and economic aspects of this task,<br>with a particular accent on European citizenship.<br><br>Addressing the challenge<br>Research dimensions to be taken into consideration:<br>- Understanding the dynamics and processes of changes that education systems have<br>undergone during the construction of the EU, as well as identifying the main actors and<br>decision-making processes behind choices affecting reforms. In particular, aspects related to<br>systemic resistance to change and the political economy of education should be taken into<br>account. Research should produce comparable, sound data on the main obstacles that actors<br>encounter when implementing education policies at all levels, by building on the existing<br>corpus of data available at local and national levels (e.g. Eurydice Network). Particular<br>attention should be paid to the role of teachers and administrative staff, and their attitude to<br>instruments and methodologies in the light of reforms designed at political level, and<br>divergences in private versus public provision of education.<br>- Providing new insight on current and future challenges linked to the implementation of<br>important European initiatives (e.g. ‘Youth on the Move’) for the modernisation of the<br>education systems and their adaptation to emerging socio-economic needs. In particular,<br>research should analyse the attitude and behaviour of the main actors vis-à-vis opportunities<br>and requests generated by such initiatives, as well as the logistics of participation and<br>institutional support for their execution.<br>- Understanding and assessing the main elements required to ensure that education systems in<br>Europe acquire the capacities necessary for change, to face upcoming challenges at societal,<br>economic and political level. Starting from a comprehensive acknowledgement of existing<br>efforts to achieve reform, research should propose typologies of education systems able to<br>shape both fully-fledged individuals and European citizens, and to stimulate creativity and<br>foster innovation, taking into account obstacles and national differences. In this framework,<br>research could assess whether scientific studies on brain power and learning ability can<br>contribute to the development of innovative educational practices, building on synergies<br>between educators, neuroscientists and other social and humanities scientists specialised in<br>the study of children.<br>- Developing complementary and innovative indicators, helping decision-makers to design<br>efficient education policies, without creating additional burdens in terms of data collection for<br>schools, but taking into account resistance to change and the different contexts contributing to<br>education (e.g. formal/informal education, special schools, shadow education systems/private supplementary tutoring, attention paid to other forms of intelligence) and focussing on the<br>lowest levels of policy implementation and grey data.<br><br>The research should cover pre-school, primary and secondary education (ISCED 0, 1, 2 and<br>3)."@en ;

                    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\">Extension services have been reformed in recent years in a number of EU Member States (partly under the pressure of decreasing public resources and changes in the thinking about the roles of the various players) but the needs for this kind of services are still very high (e.g. increasing regulatory constraints such as environment, safety, standards etc). In some of the countries of the European Union, there is also a large layer of semi-subsistence farms and small commercial farms, which are not sufficiently involved in knowledge exchanges. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /><o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\">A complete picture of the EU-27 is needed on the research – extension – farmers knowledge flows in both directions. The basis of this picture should be a comprehensive inventory of the actors in the field: basic and applied agricultural research institutes and universities, advisory and extension services, and other actors influencing research priorities and practical decision making on farms, e.g. co-operations, supply services, farmers` organisations and groups, etc. The formal and informal interactions between all these actors in the different Member States should be described. A typology of knowledge flow systems should be elaborated. Surveys will support the description of knowledge flows and will help to reveal how research and farming practice are linked, how the scientific community is informed about research needs and how the spread of technological and social innovation can be promoted.<o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\">Which systems are part of the official Farm Advisory System of the Common Agricultural Policy and which other public and private advisory services are operational in the field? Information is needed on farmers access to these services, including possible constraints for uptake of advice (e.g. price, trust etc.) and whether what is delivered meets their challenges. Is there a need for knowledge outside classical agricultural disciplines and how is it mobilised? Which forums could improve coordination, which could be good incentives to reconnect farm practice and research, to encourage uptake of advice, to valorise flows from advisors to research and vice versa, and to push application of innovative practices and techniques?<o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\" sizcache=\"4\" sizset=\"0\">The project would extend and deepen the work undertaken in the framework of the Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) collaborative working group in the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR).

The first activity (5.1.1/Area 5.1.1.1. of this<br>Work Programme) concerns a research activity which focuses on the development of a<br>normative model for the governance of RRI. The second activity (5.1.2/Area 5.1.2.1. of this<br>Work Programme) is to ensure the presence of European partners in international networks on<br>the subject matter (coordination action). Ideally, a European model for RRI to be developed<br>within the SiS research context could be advocated at the international level by a coordination<br>action.<br>Innovation used to be thought of linear process being centrally orchestrated and focussed on<br>single particular technologies. Recent research findings indicate that the innovation process is<br>more complex, and that successful innovations often are dependent on the cooperation among<br>various actors in society: e.g. academia, business operators, civil society organisations,<br>governmental bodies etc.<br>Knowledge produced, used and disseminated by all those actors eventually shapes a socially<br>robust and shared knowledge basis. This knowledge base enables innovations in<br>comprehensive societal systems, such as the health or the agricultural system. Societal actors<br>are involved throughout the whole innovation process. It assumes the existence of research<br>collectives, consisting of, for example, public research institutes, pharmaceutical companies<br>and patient organisations. Another example of more user-centred, open innovation is<br>demonstrated by the introduction of open source software.<br>RRI can only materialise in governance frameworks which take into account ethical, health,<br>safety, environmental and human rights considerations in a transparent way.<br>RRI thus refers to the \"product\" dimension on the innovation process, e.g. the type and quality<br>of the products, and to the process side of the innovation process in terms of, among other,<br>stakeholder involvement, transparency and accountability to citizens.<br>Under this topic, research should focus on models for RRI as well as on a comparative<br>analysis of existing frameworks for responsible innovation at national, European and<br>international levels. How should a governance framework for RRI at the European level look<br>like? Research should take into account the role of various actors, such as legislative, standard<br>setting and certification bodies, regulatory bodies, civil society organisations, research institutions and business operators. Research should investigate what forms of public<br>engagement can be taken into account under national, European and international regulatory<br>frameworks for innovation and what are the common and distinct features of those<br>frameworks. It should also address what are the particular constraints for citizen participation<br>at national, European and international levels.<br>In addition, the consortium will continue the work Monitoring Research and Policy Activities<br>of Science in Society (MASIS)4 to monitor trends and developments in RRI at national and<br>European levels in order (1) to inform relevant policy-makers and all other stakeholders, (2)<br>to increase the visibility of such activities in different parts of the Union and (3) to increase<br>their impact in European policy and society.

It promotes efficient, effectiveand synergetic use of public research and innovation investments and supportsMember States and regions in diversifying and upgrading existing economicsystems, and in strengthening their innovation capacity. It aims at identifyingfactors of competitiveness and bottlenecks for innovation as well as atconcentrating resources on key priorities. It also aims to harness regionaldiversity by avoiding uniformity, duplication and fragmentation in regionalinvestment goals. It combines priority-setting (EU 2020, Innovation Union) witha dynamic and entrepreneurial discovery process involving key stakeholders fromgovernment, business, academia and other knowledge-generating institutionsbased on a strong partnership. The concept of smart specialisation hastherefore the potential to exploit opportunities for joint programming andtrans-national cooperation. It might be a way to reconcile strong centripetalforces towards the emergence of world class clusters with a relatively balancedgeographical distribution of innovation capacities across countries andregions. A smart specialisation strategy is a multi-annualstrategy aimed at developing a well-performing national or regional researchand innovation system as part of the National Reform Programme. It defines apolicy mix and budgetary framework focusing on a limited number of prioritiestargeted at stimulating smart growth. The strategy is preceded by an analysisof all the assets of a region concerning innovation strengths and weaknessesand of emerging opportunities and market developments to identify the existingand potential competitive advantages in comparison with other regions.  To this end, a “Smart Specialisation Platform” willbe launched in June 2011. It will provide assistance to national and regionalinnovation policy-makers for the development and review of smart specialisationstrategies, bringing together the relevant EU funding programmes and policysupport activities in research, regional, enterprise, innovation, informationsociety-related, sustainability, health and education policies. Analysis anddata are needed to inform the process of designing smart specialisationstrategies and specifically to assess their implementation and impact on smartgrowth.

In Europe, a significant share of agricultural activities take place in highly urbanised settings, producing food and public goods (such as recreation, landscape management) and confronted with particular pressures on land resources as well as opportunities. There is a growing trend in the urban population to consume fresh and local products, demand short chain food delivery and to request more transparency on the origin of the products. Citizens are increasingly calling for the creation of a regional urban-focused food system and for support to small farmers in rural peri-urban areas, in order to increase availability and accessibility to food. Moreover, both technological and social innovation in urban peri-urban agriculture can play an important role in mitigating climate change, closing nutrient cycles and prepare effective tools for adaptation and building more resilient urban areas.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /><o:p></o:p></p> <p style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\" sizcache=\"9\" sizset=\"0\">In developing countries, there has been a growing recognition of the significance of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) for poor people's livelihood, contributing to food security and poverty alleviation.

Designed for daily, on-site use by both water utilities andgovernment/military organisations, products will provide water supply managerswith reliable tools to efficiently support:  i) integration of innovative CBRN-sensorsin intelligent monitoring systems;  ii) identifying bio-contaminationrisks and system vulnerabilities;  iii) classifying the severity of the -contamination event;  iv) evaluating the consequences and the propagation rate of thecontaminated zones; and  v) identifying the most effective response and mitigation measures. Today’s laboratory-based contaminant testing systems coupled with thecurrent practice of the use of contingency plans are impractical for dailymonitoring usage. They operate too slowly for incident control and preventionsince the full extent of the event can be rarely determined timely forefficient mitigation measures. The system should be  designed to efficiently support i) on-sitedetection of the radiological, chemical and biological contamination event; ii)classification of its severity as -“green light”, “yellow light”, or “redlight” and its nature; iii) assessment and display of the spatial and temporalpropagation of consequences and risk zoning; iv) real-time intra-agency andinter-agency information sharing for situation analysis and responsemanagement; v) communication with stakeholders, media, and customers; and vi)identification and impact monitoring of mitigation measures.

Since the last 15 years the<br>majority of the member states have undertaken intensive efforts to upgrade their scattered<br>PPDR radio networks to nation-wide digital radio networks. These existing or planned digital<br>radio networks, based on the TETRA standard or the TETRAPOL technology, comply with the demanding and specific requirements of the PPDR services in voice and short data<br>transmissions, like the ability to make group calls simply by pushing the radio PTT (Push-To-<br>Talk) button.<br>Unfortunately, until now, the existing national efficient interoperability stops at the borders:<br>the roaming capability (migration to other countries) which is available for the common<br>European citizen thanks to the GSM/3G technology (point-to-point calls), is not available, in<br>both existing technologies, for the PPDR community to save lives and reduce crimes effects.<br>It has been recognised by the Council Recommendation on improving radio communication<br>between operational units in cross-border areas of the 4-5 June 2009 that interoperability<br>between communications systems used by different first responder organisations is currently a<br>key issue for the success of the cooperation within the EU, and requests the development of<br>TETRA-TETRA and TETRA-TETRAPOL Inter System Interfaces (ISI), allowing PPDR<br>services to roam with their own equipment from one country to another one. Moreover, the<br>Recommendation encourages the implementation of interim solutions, like interconnecting<br>solutions (back-to-back relays or more sophisticated gateways), to ensure some minimal<br>cooperation, waiting for the ISI (roaming capability) that is the only technical solution<br>enabling the first responders to fulfil their international missions resulting from the existing<br>international treaties and covenants.<br>This topic aims to create and demonstrate the development of new - and integration of<br>existing - solutions into a common set of Inter System Interfaces (ISI) prototypes, directly<br>compatible with the existing European nation-wide PPDR radio networks types, in<br>combination of a bi-technology (TETRA and TETRAPOL) radio terminal concept. The ISI<br>prototype functionalities should at least include, voice and short data, international group calls<br>and individual calls, as well as the authentication of the radios working abroad. The security,<br>the privacy and the integrity of the existing systems will be maintained while sharing the<br>needed data for interoperability. The results will be properly disseminated.<br>The topic aims besides to develop the human and organisational aspects that are associated<br>with the technical solution. Therefore, taking into account the user best practices, the existing<br>legal potentialities and the roaming technical capability, an operational jointly agreed<br>procedures framework will be realised, leading to a standardised functional radio model for<br>international PPDR operations.<br>The global (technical and organisational) solution performance should be tested on the field<br>by an international panel of multidisciplinary PPDR services, following legally and<br>operationally realistic and varied scenarios. The demonstration should involve at least - a test<br>or a life version of - the main four existing nation-wide PPDR radio networks types.<br>The feasibility to make gradually interoperate the existing PPDR networks by using a scalable<br>set of ISI systems will be studied using a strong statistical base concerning the international<br>events and operations in order to propose a realistic general design."@en ;

                    "Context: The European Research Area is targeting efforts in research and innovation on the<br>current challenges faced by society. They are complex, multidimensional and require the<br>engagement of different actors alongside researchers.<br>Objective: The Mobilisation and Mutual Learning Action Plan (MMLAP) creates<br>mechanisms for effectively tackling research and innovation related challenges by proactively<br>forging partnerships between different actors (policy makers, industry, civil society, etc.) with<br>complementary knowledge and experiences. The MMLAP therefore develops forms of<br>dialogue and cooperation between science and society at different stages of the research and<br>innovation process. The MMLAP will contribute to further incorporating Science in Society<br>issues into the systems of research (public engagement, ethics, gender perspectives, young<br>people's participation, two-way communication). The partners pool experiences and<br>knowledge and better focus their respective efforts to shape research in emerging science,<br>technology and innovation in response to the views and needs of society.<br>Societal challenges and related research: The MMLAP proposed under this topic must address<br>one of the following Specific Challenges that are relevant to the Europe 2020 Strategy and<br>where a more structured dialogue and cooperation between research organisations and other<br>stakeholders is sought. The proposal must state clearly which Specific Challenge it addresses:<br>- Specific Challenge 1: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in Synthetic Biology<br>Synthetic biology, broadly understood, is the engineering of biological components and<br>systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing biological elements. It<br>holds significant promise for new vaccines, drugs and biofuels, as well as for designing novel<br>organisms with completely new functions. Notwithstanding its great potential, currently there<br>are no synthetic biology products on the market and the public is not yet much aware of this<br>field.<br>An essential challenge for Synthetic Biology is to establish and maintain open dialogue<br>between the different stakeholders: scientists, industry, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs),<br>policy makers, and also the general public. It is equally important to ensure co-creation of this<br>innovative field, as well as collaborative shaping of regulatory frameworks, aligned with<br>societal needs and expectations.<br>Regulatory challenges include for example new risk assessment needs, biosecurity and dual<br>use monitoring, intellectual property rights and promoting responsible conduct in research and<br>innovation. As synthetic biology research and its impacts occur globally, the MML should<br>also include perspectives from outside Europe, in particular from dominant players in this<br>field. <br><br>and body: human enhancement<br>The cognitive sciences are making more and more inroads into the human psyche, behaviour<br>and morality. Using the insights coming from the cognitive sciences, as well as from robotics,<br>the life sciences and ICT, human enhancement technologies are being developed to not only<br>enhance the physical abilities of humans, but also their cognitive and emotional abilities and<br>performance. Creating \"better than well\" options within our healthcare will pose societal and<br>ethical challenges regarding, among others, what it means to be 'healthy', blurring the<br>distinction between enhancement and therapy, and in terms of creating disparities between<br>those who would opt in or would opt out of enhancement. On a deeper level, better<br>knowledge about the human brain and body and means to model and intervene in it, affect our<br>understanding of personal responsibility and behaviour.<br>What expectations and research agendas drive these developments in Europe? To what extent<br>is society ready and prepared to accommodate the transformative impacts that the envisaged<br>developments may have? The MML should elaborate on a European research agenda and<br>explore policy issues that will need to be addressed in order to ensure that this field develops<br>in accordance with fundamental values such as human dignity, equality, individual freedom<br>and solidarity.<br>- Specific Challenge 3: Healthy and active ageing<br>The Europe 2020 Strategy identifies ageing as a long-term societal challenge. Action under<br>EU 2020 core priorities for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth requires promoting a<br>healthy and active ageing population to allow for social cohesion and higher productivity. By<br>2025, more than 20% of Europeans will be 65 or over and the number of citizens over 80 will<br>increase particularly rapidly. This major demographic trend will affect all Member States in<br>many policy areas, from pensions' reform to disease prevention and social care. At the same<br>time, the ageing population has to be seen as a productive section of society and as an active<br>and demanding consumer force. Hence, the prevailing deficit model of old age must give way<br>to a more holistic approach focusing on active and dignified wellbeing. Mostly, at the<br>European level this new approach requires to deepen the knowledge on the demographic<br>dynamics of ageing (health, life expectancy, family) especially as determinants of activity and<br>well-being at older age. Even more importantly, it requires the coordination and coherence of<br>efforts among various actors and across many areas in order to facilitate social innovation and<br>maximize the impact of the efforts undertaken.<br>The proposed MML invites stakeholders from at least 10 countries, from various sectors (i.e.<br>researchers of different disciplines, older people organisations, national, regional and local<br>authorities, health managers, industry) to set up frameworks of collaboration that combine<br>technological and social approaches. These frameworks will have a strong multiplier effect,<br>function as incubators of responsible social innovation and explore new market opportunities<br>for the development of products, models and services in response to the needs of older people.<br>In particular, this MML should include actions that:<br>- Raise awareness of the value of active ageing and of the useful contribution older<br>people make to society and economy;<br>- Connect local actions and networks of reference, creating a European social<br>innovation incubator network;<br>- Identify and disseminate good practices;<br>- Identify the scale and scope of opportunities for social innovation that mobilize the<br>potential of older people to participate in developing their own solutions;<br>- Develop, where appropriate, inclusive innovative design processes for smart products<br>and services that are usable by all population categories without the need for age-specific<br>design<br>- Address the physical and mental health related challenges of the ageing population in<br>a transparent and ethical manner by e.g. age and gender specific clinical trials and the<br>inclusion of older people’s associations and other relevant Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)<br>in the health care decisions.<br><br>Implementation and management<br>Content of the MML Action Plan: The partners implement the proposed MMLAP in an<br>integrated, systemic and transdisciplinary way to address the questions raised under the<br>selected Specific Challenge. The MMLAP activities may take place at different stages of the<br>research cycle (defining research agendas, during the course of research, or exploiting<br>research results). They encompass public engagement in research (PER), such as<br>participatory processes involving citizens and CSO's. The MMLAP activities may also<br>include ethical issues, the development of expertise in support of policy-making, gender<br>issues in science and/or young people's participation in science. The forms of dialogue and<br>cooperation between the partners should be based on a participatory and mutual learning<br>approach. Particular attention should be given to making accessible to the MMLAP<br>participants the various types of knowledge concerned (capacity-building, training, etc.).

                    "<span> <p>As regards </span><strong>Climate and Climate Change monitoring</strong>, space based observations provide a key source of data at global scales of the earth’s environment, climate change, and the provision of Climate services. An identification of the key observables has been undertaken by the second Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) report 2003 in defining Essential Climate Variables (ECV), and these have been updated in 2010. The GMES services in the Land, Marine and Atmosphere domain include within their product portfolios a wide range ofparameters which may already correspond to these ECVs, or may contribute to their determination and generation. More importantly though, space based observations processed by the GMES services will contribute to climate change analyses if the continuity of the underlying measured physical parameters with previously existing data records can be reconciled. In conjunction with GCOS, FP7 climate change relevant projects, and ESA Climate Change Initiative projects specific efforts are to be undertaken by the FP7 GMES projects to further upgrade their product catalogues to include this climate relevant validation and information.</p><span> <p>It is proposed to support this effort through a </span><em>coordination activity</em>, devoted to coordinating the identification of available physical measurements, which can be reconciled with previously existing data records, to form long time series. This work should thus help to substantiate how GMES observations and products can contribute to climate change analyses, by establishing the extent to which observations complement existing Climate Data Records. Gaps in the ongoing activities should be identified, thereby contributing to the formulation of the GMES climate service theme and laying the observational basis for service activities. Reanalyses will be important for improving and synthesizing historical climate records, and for providing regional detail in a global context necessary for policy development &amp; implementation. Hence an important goal is the integration of parameters into the re-analysis chain. Such re-analysis should go beyond that of existing re-analysis projects and should provide a truly coupled gridded re-analysis which incorporates full exchanges and interactions between atmosphere, ocean, land, including the hydrological cycle.</p> <p>The Coordination activity should:<br>- Propose a structured process for delivering ECVs through the stepped and quality controlled elaboration of Climate Data Records (CDR), the latter being derived from prioritisation of the most appropriate input data sets;<br>- Propose a validation process aiming at qualifying the accuracy of the climate variables; <br>- Propose a feedback mechanism ensuring that the results of the re-analysis process get appropriately reflected into updates of the CDR;<br>- Propose a process to compare the results of different reanalysis techniques.</p> <p sizset=\"0\" sizcache=\"12\">The proposal should engage with representative researchers in the GMES projects, ESA Climate Change Initiative projects, and operational EO agencies, such as EUMETSAT, forging closer links to Climate and Climate change researchers and modellers at national level in Europe, as well as globally. Links will also be made with projects funded under the FP7 Theme Environment which are aimed at developing a more effective interface between climate change knowledge and the policy making process.</p> <p>The dialogue mechanisms set up in this coordination action should provide a forum for<br>providers of EO data and climate researchers to assess the status of available observational records, integrating space data with in-situ records, to establish the foundations for a validated base of EO data for climate research and long time period re-analysis. Already during the lifetime of the project, it should provide a continuous means for ongoing research projects and other funded activities to better coordinate their efforts.</p> <p>Note: Limits on the EU financial contribution apply.

Additionally, developments related to “smart grids”, which advance beyond passive logging systems that require manual downloading, i.e. ‘intelligent’ sensor networks allowing active communication of data to centralised systems for integration with other environmental datasets could offer novel solutions to collect data operationally. The uninterrupted availability of sensor networks should be addressed, as well as their data production and linkage into networks in line with the GEOSS Data Sharing Principles. Activities should enhance the convergence with space systems, as well as the harmonisation of exchange mechanisms.

The successful proposal will exploit state-of-the-art techniques and technologies, such as plant and soil water sensor technologies, weather forecast tools, ICT control systems, remote sensing, satellite and GIS technologies, web potentialities and other innovative relevant technologies, for developing and testing integrated and automated precision irrigation supporting tools, models and devices to optimise irrigation water use at farm level.

                    "<p>For Europe to be active in space in the long term, be it in earth-orbit or across the solar system, it is essential that space technologies with key capabilities are at its disposal. For space industry to be competitive with such technologies, not only on a European market, it is crucial to position itself in the market with products or components which are a generation ahead, leap-frogging competitors. Such developments should not be driven by incremental improvements, but rather by radical innovation which may then lead to “disruptive technologies”.</p> <p>Proposals should thus address technologies which enable far-reaching space activities, addressing typical challenges already identified as key for a presence in space.</p> <p>Key goals and associated challenges are:<br>- Accessing space - new concepts for low orbital flight and beyond, and subsequent re-entry, allowing also for re-usable vehicles, employing new thermal shielding and propulsion concepts and low risk return strategies, docking concepts, small satellites for demonstration of critical and disruptive technologies;<br>-  Remaining active in space – addressing power generation and storage in space as well as (wire-less) power transmission, meeting the energy requirements for long duration missions, as well as making use of novel power sources and addressing high throughput deep space communications;<br>- · Protection against the hazards of space – techniques for survivability in space including protection against environmental influences (such as radiation), new materials and shielding methods;<br>- Providing a base beyond earth - next generation space habitation modules, the ability to assemble and deploy large space structures in orbit or on planetary surfaces, propellant handling for in-space fuelling and storage, taking benefit from high degree of self-sustainability and autonomy.</p> <p>To address these goals, components with highly advanced performances well beyond current available specifications are required, as well as new system concepts, thus providing a wide range of research opportunities for space industry to engage in.<br>In the domain of power generation and transmission, spacecraft currently rely to a large extent on the in-situ generation of electricity via solar panels for their on-board power needs, and on rocket propulsion for in-space manoeuvring and travel beyond earth orbit, both of which can impose significant limitations with regard to long-duration exploration missions. Proposals are invited to develop breakthrough concepts and technologies for the generation of electrical power in space and the development of associated electrical propulsion systems that may be suited to long-duration exploration missions beyond earth orbit and capable of catering for the power and propulsion needs of future human exploration missions. Proposals could examine<br>novel technologies for the collection and utilisation of solar energy in space, for example through the remote collection and delivery of this energy to spacecraft. Proposals addressing technologies for more efficient energy storage and energy transmission are also welcome. To allow cross-fertilisation for these energy supply relevant topics, possible future terrestrial applications of technologies could be identified to meet power generation and storage needs, as well as adaptation of technologies currently used on earth for enhanced performance in space.</p> <p>Proposals should address research topics which demonstrate a clear long term vision that is far beyond the state of the art, by engaging with high-risk ideas rather than the refinement of current approaches.</p> <p>Participants are expected to demonstrate how their proposals add value for Europe in light of developments at national level or ongoing activities at ESA.<br>The participation of SMEs is encouraged, as this could potentially enhance the innovative impact of proposals and could lead to strengthening of research alliances for space technologies. The inclusion of international partners (from third countries (ICPC), countries which have signed an agreement with the EU covering Science and Technology, as well as other space-faring nations (such as the US and Japan) could help to advance technology and enhance research partnerships with established space powers. These aspects should be taken into account in the proposal. International partners will be eligible to participate and to be funded.</p> <p>Note: Limits on the EU financial contribution apply.

                    "The objective of this topic is to enable research on common challenges relevant to all South East Asian countries that could be met more effectively by collective action rather than individually. The research should be multidisciplinary, including the humanities; it should use and integrate quantitative and qualitative methodologies, develop forward-looking approaches when relevant, and create knowledge platforms to ensure exchange and transfer of knowledge within South East Asia and with Europe. It should help European researchers specialised in South East Asian studies to strengthen their cooperation in the framework of the European Research Area. <p style=\"\" mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:justify\";margin-bottom:auto\"=\"\">The research should address the following issues with the aim of investigating more closely the processes leading to national and regional integration in South East Asia; and analyse their broader geopolitical significance for the region and for the European Union:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li style=\"\" mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:justify;margin-bottom:auto\"=\"\">Issues      of national integration. All countries in the region are confronted with      the difficulties, resolved with varying success, of integrating large      ethnic, cultural, religious and social diversities into national      frameworks. At the same time, current trends of economic modernisation and      development have increased inequalities between cities, rural areas, and      provinces. Research should therefore analyse the relationships evolving between      central and local powers, and between central authorities and minorities.      It should include the transformation of rural areas, the participation of      peripheries in national development, and the place of ethnic, cultural and      religious minorities within this national framework.</li><li style=\"\" mso-margin-top-alt:auto;text-align:justify;margin-bottom:auto\"=\"\">Issues      of regional integration. The South East Asia      region has since ancient times played an important role as a crossroads      between civilisations. Historically, Hinduism played a prevailing role in      the development of Southeast Asian city-states and centres of      civilisation. The expanding economic and cultural influence of China      has been significant recently. Research should bear on the mobility of      people, goods, ideas and cultures in the region through exchanges,      migration and diasporas, changing frontier dynamics (notably through the      development of regions and towns with cross-border significance), the      growing influence of China (possibly rivalled by India tomorrow).

This<strong> </strong>topic aims at<strong> </strong>ensuring a genuine chance for “emerging ideas” to be funded and consequently follows a complete bottom-up approach.  </p> <p sizcache=\"6\" sizset=\"1\">This topic is also designed to provide reward for <strong><em>“high risk / high impact”</em></strong> approach and to vigorously promote multi-disciplinarity. Research should focus on novel technologies and novel materials for energy applications, should have tangible objectives, go beyond conventional paths, and be highly innovative and very ambitious – the FET \"spirit\".</p> <p sizcache=\"6\" sizset=\"2\">However, this topic is “purpose driven” and not “blue-sky” research. “Increased understanding” alone would not be considered sufficiently tangible. Projects should try reaching clearly defined scientific goals and/or creating a new basic technology. They should have the potential to open up new fields of inquiry and be well beyond the international state of the art. </p> <p sizcache=\"6\" sizset=\"3\">When developing a new technology one often encounters gaps in understanding that require going back to science to develop new knowledge. This feedback loop between science and technology is a critical part of how progress is made. The more active the feedback loop, the higher the likelihood of rapid success. This key element of <strong>innovation</strong> is at the core of this FET topic.</p> <p sizcache=\"6\" sizset=\"4\">Also, real breakthroughs in the energy sector are quite often due to the radical upgrade in the properties of the materials. Proposals related to advanced materials for energy applications, and particularly proposals on materials that could find their way into a continuum of energy applications, are within the scope of this topic (providing they have the FET \"spirit\"). </p> <p sizcache=\"6\" sizset=\"5\">Any research that constitutes a technology demonstration or a combination of existing technologies will not be considered for funding. Research directed towards hypothetical phenomena, with no convincing evidence as to their existence also falls out of scope of this topic. </p>"@en ;

More and more industrial parks do offer innovative energy services business to business, within the parks. This approach aims to extend such services to cities or city districts, ideally through heating/cooling smart grids. Low temperature heat that is wasted today in nearby industrial cooling towers, air conditioning systems, cooling of data centres, etc. or heat from manufacturing industry, industrial buildings, office buildings, data centres, private homes, shall be collected and used to provide heating and cooling for end users in city districts. Space heating and domestic hot water production might be complemented by high efficiency heat pumps. Cooling can be supplied through the use of cold from rivers, lakes, ground source water, liquefied natural gas terminals, cooling or freezing warehouses to provide cooling systems for end users in urban environment. The objective is to demonstrate the high energy efficient innovative technologies and measures resulting in very low energy districts. All elements and systems that could contribute to a better energy efficiency and sustainability through integrated design and planning should be envisaged, including heat recovery technologies and very efficient water/waste management, enhanced systems for energy behaviour monitoring and demand response and load control systems. The system should be based primarily on recovering waste heat (or using heat from e.g. waste incineration) and adapting the temperature levels of the grid to the applications: floor and radiant wall heating for example allows very efficient use of low temperatures (mostly below 30°C); radiant wall and ceiling cooling allows efficient cooling with water temperatures up to 20°C. High efficiency heat pumps may adjust the temperature to 60°C for domestic hot water production if needed. Also the most efficient forms of renewables (solar thermal, biomass boilers or combined heat and power) shall be used to supply a significant part of the remaining energy needs, while the return on investment for the energy saving measures should be calculated and presented and should be acceptable under current market standards.<br>Building energy management systems should be combined with district energy management systems and city energy management systems.<br></p>"@en ;

                    "Labour markets have undergone substantial reforms, stillunderway, over the past decade(s), due in part to activation and flexicuritypolicies. Such policies have had some success since employment rates had, untilrecently, been rising. However, there is also substantial evidence aboutunfavourable tendencies and persistent rigidities (dualisation, in-workpoverty, low employment rates for migrants, low levels of geographicalmobility, high labour taxation …), which are at odds with active employment andinclusion policies. Besides, the recent economic shock was very detrimental toemployment in many countries, and longer-term effects are very likely. With 11unemployed for every job vacancy, according to Eurostat, the EU will needinnovative policies beyond flexicurity and labour market activation. TheEuropean flagship ‘An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’ encourages activities to supportjob creation and to improve the quality of work and working conditions, while ‘Youthon the Move’ supports innovative activities to combat youth unemployment.  The objective of the research is thus to identifypost-crisis sustainable policies that, by giving a very high priority toemployment, particularly for young people and other vulnerable categories ofworkers, can raise the level of good-quality employment and diminishunemployment along with its economic and social costs.

                    "<span> <p>Technical content/scope: </span>Manufacturing of nanostructured surfaces aims at fundamentally affecting the functionality of manufactured parts. This requires control, over a relatively large areas (not just over nanoscale areas), of parameters related to tribology, optics, fluidics (affect flow properties by changing the surface), adhesion. Current state-of-the-art processes for measuring at the nanoscale have significant practical limitations as they measure over small distances. The characterisation of surface structures at the nanoscale over large areas, in terms of improved and novel operational performance, will open the way for new products into existing markets. </p> <p>Nanostructured coatings are used in diverse applications from automobile components where low friction can increase the fuel efficiency of transport systems, through cutting tools where increased efficiency in manufacture can be realised, to forging and forming operations where increased production rates and less tool wear can be achieved. They provide potential to improve energy efficiency in many areas, with projected improvements in fuel efficiency of 20% in transport and 30% to 50% in manufacturing processes along with major tool lifetime improvements. Reduction of friction in fluid transport (drag) is also known to be improved by introduction of nanostructured coatings. Friction control for transport is a key technology identified by the International Energy Agency. The key performance properties of nanocoatings are the low friction that can be achieved, the reduction and control of wear, and the durability of the coatings under the conditions that pertain in real applications. These properties will in turn depend on how the chemistry of the wear interface, and the mechanical properties of the coatings such as hardness, fracture and adhesion. </p> <p>Projects proposed under this topic shall aim at establishing advanced measurement capability in one or more of the following areas: <br>- To resolve the structure of surfaces of materials at the nanoscale at an acceptable speed. A step change is required in measurement techniques, sampling methodologies and data processing to enable key 3D physical parameters to be measured in a reasonable time frame. Research is also required to validate correlations made between the physical measurements and functional effects. The results will produce a knowledge base enabling designers and producers to shift from empirical to computer aided approaches. Beyond this, a new raft of measurement tools will be needed to support the tooling of microstructures within the prototyping, product development and manufacturing phase. <br><br>- To assess the performance of newly developed nanostructured coatings. This should deliver reliable and accurate measurement results at the nanoscale for morphology (roughness profile), for chemical composition (of surface layers and wear debris), for basic mechanical properties (indentation hardness and stiffness), and for the relevant tribological properties of the coatings (e.g., friction coefficient) in a range of highly demanding industrial applications. In addition, new nanoscale methods need to be developed to evaluate the durability of nanostructured coatings (e.g., scratch resistance). The corresponding materials data are required for input into the design of new coating systems to meet challenging operational demands. Methods also need to be developed to evaluate the durability of coatings for severe environments. </p> <p>Preference will be given to projects that will lead to traceable measurement methods which can become the basis of international standards. In stage-2 proposals, an indicator of this potential will be the involvement of metrology institutes and/or standardisation bodies. </p> <p>In order to ensure an efficient implementation and maximum impact of SME-related activities, the leading role of SMEs with R&amp;D capacities will be evaluated under the criteria 'Implementation' and 'Impact': the coordinator does not need to be an SME but the participating SMEs should have the decision making power in the project management; and the output should be for the benefit of the participating SMEs and the targeted SME dominated industrial communities. </p>"@en ;

                    "<p sizcache=\"10\" sizset=\"0\">The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) identifies marine biodiversity as a key descriptor for the assessment of the environmental status of marine waters. However the understanding of the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine biological diversity are still only partially understood. There are a number of aspects of these relationships which need to be better understood in order to fully achieve a good environmental status (GES) of marine waters, a target of the MSDF. The topic will contribute, in a harmonized way for the four regions identified in the MSFD, to (i) improve our understanding of the impact of human activities and variations associated to climate on marine biodiversity, (ii) test indicators (referred in the Commission Decision on GES) and develop new ones for  assessment at several ecological levels (species, habitat, ecosystems) and for the characterization and status classification of the marine waters, (iii) develop, test and validate, on the basis of observations, innovative integrative modelling tools in order to further strengthen our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes in space and time. The resultant models should be developed for implementation as operational tools for managers, decision takers and policy makers. The project shall also contribute to (i) enable the adaptive development of management (ecosystem-based management approach) strategies and management measures as a result of their implementation taking into account the role of industry and relevant stakeholders, (ii) provide economic assessment of the consequences of management practices, (iii) identify the barriers (socio-economic and legislative) that prevent the GES to be achieved (e.g. eutrophication), (iv) provide a set of policy options for the relevant authorities. In addition the project should propose and demonstrate the utility of innovative monitoring systems capable of providing data on a range of parameters, efficiently and effectively, that may be used as indicators of good environmental status.</p> <p sizcache=\"12\" sizset=\"0\"> </p>"@en ;

                    "Understanding diversity and its governanceplays a key role in the institutional arrangements and mechanisms needed toface social cohesion challenges in the city. Diversity is regarded as a problemby some, but is seen as an essential condition for urban development by others.However, tensions between growing diversity and social cohesion in the city asa whole have not been systematically researched. This weakness needs to beovercome through a much greater appreciation of the character, scale andspatial expressions of diversity and the ways in which diversity connects toinequality and social cohesion, of the political and social impacts in thiscontext of the different modes of urban multi-level governance includinginteractions between central and local governments, of the restructuring andtransformation of inequalities and segregations between inhabitants’ socialcategories, whether ethnic, gender or other, and of the impact on urban socialcohesion of community, community building and fragmentation at theneighbourhood, city and higher geographical levels. The research requestedbelow aims to make a substantial contribution to this. The research should also help prepare theground for the introduction of new tools of urban governance for cohesion anddiversity such as participatory ways of planning, with a strong focus on localdevelopment, as well as the inclusion of ‘strategies from below’ into urbanpolicies. The ongoing debate in Europe on citizenship practices is relevanthere, with the growing conviction that these practices are helping to reinforcethe social fabric as well as to incorporate different views of societies’well-being, even if sometimes not free of contradictory effects. Such practicesinvolve the full utilisation of legally-established citizenship rights (formalcitizenship practices) as well as socially innovative citizenship practiceswith the purpose of making bottom-linked collective decision-making and socialprotection more effective for all inhabitants (informal citizenship practices),usually considered as essential for ‘governance in diversity’. Researchmethodologies appropriate to this should be used and further developed, notablya multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach in which urban actorsrepresenting urban diversity play a significant role, mobilising their oftentacit knowledge. The methodology, or appropriate parts of it, should betransferable to urban policy analysis and practice, and proposals shouldindicate ways in which this might be done. Citiesin Europe are almost continuously confronted with the important issue ofgovernance in diversity. Although urban history shows a high degree ofsimilarity across the continent, there are considerable differences betweencities in different parts of Europe. These differences need to be appreciatedin their historical and geographical context, particularly differences ineconomic development, population change and social cohesion. The research underthis challenge needs to take these into account. TheEuropean Union favours the competitiveness of European cities in the world andat the same time is aware of the importance of promoting social and territorialcohesion. In policy practice, however, the conciliation of the two objectivesis difficult. European institutions at various levels need to be more informedregarding the character, scale and spatial expressions of diversity and theways in which it is related to inequality and social cohesion. The researchoutcomes should help to inform the appreciation of how some policy choices,including those taken in the domain of economic policies, are more capable thanothers in producing social cohesion.   Research dimensions to be taken into consideration:  - Understanding the gap between policy intentionsdealing with social cohesion and diversity, on the one hand, and the actualimplementation and outcomes of those policies, on the other. This shouldinclude discourses and policies of ‘social and cultural mixing’ and‘multidimensional diversity’ (including social inequalities and differences interms of age, gender, ethnic origin, religion, lifestyles, etc.), and criticalassessments of the rationales behind them and their assumed impacts, as well aseconomic discourses and policies affecting cities, such as the linking ofcompetitiveness and innovation with social cohesion.  - Understanding the new relationships thathave emerged between the private and the public domains due to the ways inwhich diversity of various kinds is being dealt with, their impacts on socialcohesion and how they might be better governed to improve such cohesion. Newapproaches to the meaning of public urban space, its governance and management,are often leading to real or symbolic privatisation. Has this affectedaccountability and the ‘spaces for democracy’, the decision-making spacesneeded for the proper working of democracy? Has it had an impact on social,cultural and political rights in local arenas, and should these rights beredefined and re-institutionalised? One particular focus is how multilevelgovernance actually affects local practices; another concerns the democraticcontrol of security in public spaces and the risk of erosion of civic rights ofmembers of communities under surveillance. - Understanding conflicting value systems,social practices and interests, in cities of diversity as well as in fragmentedcities, and how their governance might be better organised to improve socialcohesion. Is there a need for new modes of communication between urban groups andcommunities, political decision-makers and others? Research focusing ondifferences in civic and political organisation and their role in improvingrelations, solving social conflicts and facilitating community developmentshould be included. The research should take into account the importance ofgovernance dynamics in empowering disadvantaged groups as well as creatingdemocratic mechanisms for conflict resolution, with a special focus onintercultural competences and learning processes. - Understanding in greater depthinterculturality and ways of learning to live together with differences ofculture, economic and social practice, and identities, and how this might bebetter managed. How accumulated knowledge from daily practices in society atlarge (schools, public administrations, neighbourhood communities, inbusinesses, etc.) can be taken into account in achieving this. The role ofurban planning in its various aspects, collective services and welfare increating collective identities should also be included.   They should also include in their proposalany useful cooperation with the Council of Europe and UN Habitat."@en ;

                    "PPDR (public protection and disaster relief) communications systems play a vital role in all<br>security operations and involve a significant national investment. Existing and planned<br>TETRA and TETRAPOL networks provide a secure and resilient mobile voice and data<br>infrastructure with limited features matched to the special requirements of PPDR, including<br>broadcast, dynamic secure groups, push to talk, call priority and secure roaming. Elements of<br>the investment have a life of 20-30 years, however the growing demand for high-speed data<br>communication means that the current system capacity will be exceeded, requiring an upgrade<br>or replacement to the system at some later date. This reality will raise challenging funding<br>issues into the future.<br>This topic seeks research to inform the medium/long term evolution of PPDR networks,<br>including the overall architecture, matching radio communication platforms to type of<br>operation, development of PPDR standards, use of commercial standards, use of services<br>provided by commercial operators, security and privacy, interoperability within and between<br>nations, and frequency allocation issues. The research should set out potential options, the<br>economic implications and possible migration paths from the current and planned PPDR<br>provision. Architectural solutions can range from complete replacement of PPDR systems,<br>evolution of existing networks through upgrades, overlay of additional networks, for example<br>based on GSM/LTE, partial or full use of commercial operators networks (also Mobile Virtual<br>Network Operator (MVNO)), or some combination of these approaches. The proposers should<br>assess some technological issues as well as economical issues in view of the replacement of<br>PPDR network in the future.<br>Proposers should also establish some basic data which are still missing related to police forces<br>and first responders like identification of organisation(s) in each members states, number of<br>people involved in each organisation (with and without operational and in the field wireless<br>communication needs; to identify and to count the national events, national cross organisation<br>events, cross border events, external EU event, in short to build a strong statistical base in<br>order to help to build business cases.<br>Proposers should also investigate how to port existing TETRA/TETRAPOL functionalities<br>required by police forces and first responders like, \"push to talk\" function, \"group call\" function, EU wide group dynamic management; and high priority service and quality of<br>service to another type of network.<br>Proposers should also study the migration costs, training costs, etc taking into account the<br>time frame of such an evolution and the actual \"PPDR communication status\" of the Member<br>States.<br>It is expected that another element of the research will be consideration of future<br>communication demands on PPDR, taking into account the current levels of use and<br>proposing plausible scenarios for growth and adoption of new services over the coming 10-20<br>years. Factors that might be considered could include changes in PPDR operators processes<br>and behaviours as PPDR networks provide more services, the extent to which video data will<br>be used, increasing database access, deployment of sensors that depend upon<br>communications. If needed, particular attention should be placed on future frequency<br>spectrum requirements. This analysis should be used to develop indicative business cases for<br>options that are proposed.

The EU's population is ageing faster than that in most other world regions, so without activating the potential of seniors, it will not be able to meet the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy nor to start a path towards long-term growth.

This requires a better understanding of (i) the potential of the ecosystem services and natural capital approach and (ii) how best to operationalise these concepts within key regulatory frameworks and in decision making processes. Integrated natural, social and economic research is needed to assess the ecosystem services relevant to human well-being, and analyse links between and comparisons across locales, sectors, scales and time (for example, across a coherent set of case studies) in a range of social-ecological systems that must at least include fresh water bodies, coastal zones, urban and rural areas and their interfaces. Focusing on the bio-physical control of ecosystem services, research will examine the effects of multiple drivers (including the use of renewable resources), structural and functional factors (including biodiversity and tipping points), and human feedbacks on ecosystem services. Such research is to (i) provide a better understanding of how drivers and management, including the green infrastructure approach and ecological restoration, change ecosystem services, and (ii) explore, demonstrate and validate mechanisms, instruments and best practices that will serve to maintain and enhance a sustainable flow of a broad range of services from ecosystems while preserving their ecological value and biological diversity. Focusing on the socio-economic implications of choices on the use of ecosystem services, research will address the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and between components of social and individual well-being that arise from the demands on these systems. Such research is to (iii) qualify and quantify these trade-offs and synergies and link them to the respective stakeholders across locales, sectors, scales and time, (iv) identify the potential for the development of innovative and sustainable processes derived from ecosystem services, and (v) explore, demonstrate and validate instruments and practices that will serve to align disconnected and conflicting interests and take power asymmetries into account in balancing trade-offs in social and individual well-being. In both bio-physical and socio-economic dimensions, work will (vi) develop methods and coherent and shared protocols to provide consistent and integrated datasets and knowledge (vii) and explore and where possible implement ways to ensure the perennity of any key data base, decision support system or other major product of the research. Integrating these strands of investigation, research is to provide plural and conditional alternatives for operationalising the concept of ecosystem services and natural capital to support the formulation and implementation of regulatory frameworks such as the Water Framework Directive, Air Quality Framework Directive, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Green Infrastructure approach, the Thematic Strategy on the Urban Environment and Environmental Impact Assessments.<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif;font-size:medium\" sizcache=\"19\" sizset=\"1\"></span></p></div></div>"@en ;

                    "European societies — and thegrowing European society — are becoming increasingly complex from the viewpointof both individuals and their families. Families have evolved into manydifferent configurations that make the term ‘family’ a rather diverse notion. Individualscombine in various forms of households or groups with different kinds ofsocial, sexual and cultural bonds. Taken together, these different types offamilies may have more hopes of self-fulfilment, but also have to face highstrains on their relationships and increasing risks of break-up of intimate andprivate relations. Transitions in life-course and in family life have becomemore complicated, and some have become more frequent, with both planned andintended transitions (getting a job, parenthood, becoming retired), and unforeseentransitions (separation, divorce, unemployment, widowhood). Unemployment, on the one hand,and rising employment rates (especially for women and older persons), on theother hand, have led to various challenges in managing family life. As a result,we increasingly find young people and families living in precarious conditionswith adverse effects on decisions to become parents. There is general consensusthat the transmission of precariousness across generations is unacceptable,since it hampers children’s chances in the education system, then in futurecareer and income trajectories. The decreasing number of childrenas well as high societal expectations regarding parenting can also lead to alack of experience in the care of infants and child rearing, with a loss ofconfidence in parenthood skills. At the same time, modern and assistedreproduction techniques give considerable scope for establishing differenttypes of family. EU laws in this area varywidely in scope, rights and obligations and still leave significant socialdemands unsatisfied. Despite many recent developmentsin gender equality (for example, in educational attainment and generalemployment rates), family management is still strongly gender-biased and experiencedvery differently by mothers and fathers. The role of grand-parents or elderlypeople has changed, and more generally, the clear distinctions between the differentroles of different generations and social positions have become blurred.Finally, in recent years, recognition of violent behaviour within families hastriggered debates and policy reactions in many European countries, demystifyingthe traditional positive values often associated with the nuclear family. The challenge is thus tounderstand these family transitions and their effects, i.e. how these varioustypes of families are likely to evolve, and how adequate policies to address thedifferent types of family can support them as important social institutions. Under Welfare State regimes, policymakershave varied in the amount of attention they have given to families, dependingon political, cultural and historical patterns. However, established policiesmay become less relevant under new patterns of modernisation, and policymakersmay have to devise new regulatory and redistribution policies that supportmodernisation and maintain meaningful social bonds within various forms offamilies and societies.  The transitions experienced byfamilies, economies and societies are so important that new innovative policiesmay have to be designed in a number of areas, whether for care, employment,education, lifelong learning, cultural activities or leisure, for instance. Addressing the challenge requiresa multidisciplinary approach combining social sciences and the humanities, withthe involvement of civil society actors.

This heterogeneity of the biodiversity datasets needs to be addressed in the context of the implementation of several environmental policies like the Habitats Directive in Europe, the future Marine Strategy Directive Framework, or the Intergovernmental science policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).The topic is intended as a European Contribution to the assessment of global biological resources, across both terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems, linking biodiversity to environment structures. It will support the implementation of the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which is developing a coordinated, global network gathering and sharing information on biodiversity and ecosystems. It will integrate long-term national and European biodiversity resources and Global biodiversity data sources, (e.g., LTER-Europe, UNEP-WCMC, IUCN and its RedList of threaten species, GBIF), into GEO BON to provide a basis for dynamic and adaptive strategies for biodiversity conservation under changing environmental and societal conditions. Comprehensive and standardized biodiversity datasets, biological knowledge and filling out of taxonomic gaps at different scales using remotely-sensed, in-situ and collection-based observations will be delivered. Changes affecting the stock and nature of biological resources will be estimated by modelling distributions of species and their sensitivity to, environmental changes.

                    "Claiming humanrights ranging from freedom of expression and association to protection fromtorture or other degrading treatment is a prominent feature of democratisationmovements. This was the case in Eastern Europe before the fall of the BerlinWall/Iron Curtain, to cases in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Whilehuman rights may seem to be taken for granted in the EU and other democraticpolities, their widespread violation by authoritarian regimes as well as democracies(usually by way of exceptions to the general rule, on the basis of concernsover safety or security), indicates that human rights are far from uncontested.Not only is the problem persistent; it is also changing in nature due toglobalisation, new forms of violence and war, and technological advances ininformation and communication technologies, biological sciences, transport andother fields. All of these factors influence how rights are perceived and areprotected or violated. We need to build on past and present knowledge, but alsoto investigate changes and identify ongoing patterns and future trends.   Fundamentalrights figure prominently in EU external actions (including trade, with clauseson human rights in bilateral agreements since 1995) and the enlargementprocesses (especially since the introduction of the Copenhagen criteria) aswell as in internal policies (from anti-discrimination to migration andjustice).  The EuropeanCharter of Fundamental Rights, which became binding with the ratification ofthe Lisbon Treaty and the prospect of EU accession to the European Conventionof Human Rights, adds judicial as well as political and symbolic dimensions tothe EU's commitment to take such rights seriously. Such commitment and legalobligations are, however, challenged by factors that need deeper analysis so asto inform EU external and internal policies, and to foster theircoherence.   Researchdimensions to be taken into consideration: - Provision of asystematic overview and comparative analysis of the social, economic, legal,cultural or other factors that facilitate or hamper the protection of humanrights in the external and internal policies of the EU — as well as thecoherence and consistency between such external and internal dimensions infields such as cross-border mobility, counter-terrorism and judicialcooperation. The role of national, EU and international human rightsinstitutions in monitoring fundamental rights could be part of the analysis.   - The protectionof human rights as a component of global governance, given that globalisationbrings the prospect of global diffusion of wealth, but also entails the risk ofdeeper inequalities. Research could examine why and how large numbers of people–especially in lower income countries - may see their basic rights eroded ifglobalisation is not wisely managed. It could focus on specific rights and/ortheir interactions, namely rights of access to health, education and familyplanning, to food, water, clear air or safe energy; and how such access may behelped or hindered by global regulatory frameworks or the absence of these (including,for example, on Intellectual Property Rights). The share of responsibility andlegal competences between the EU and its Member States in the above (includingtrade, development and other multilateral instruments –and their consistencywith internal policies) could also be addressed. - The use ofexisting indicators (e.g. for understanding the human rightssituation at country level, for assessing the capacities of rights holders andduty bearers) or the development of new indicators could help in mapping andidentifying the main danger spots, as well as areas in which there have been improvements.Assessing human freedoms is often contentious —thusany choice of indicators, and the methodology to develop them, should betransparent to allow informed debate. A forward-looking perspective on developmentsin human rights violations and protection would be another useful researchcomponent."@en ;

A vital soil provides numerous services to the welfare of society, and it is of fundamental importance for the production of food and feed. The need to increase agricultural production over the past sixty years resulted in the massive use of mineral fertilisers by farmer. Considering the current World population trend, the expected increase in feed and food demand, the limited availability of productive agricultural land, and with a view to reduce the farmers dependence on mineral fertilisers, alternative and viable plant nutrition strategies need to be found. By improving knowledge on plants and bio-effectors interactions and related physiological and chemical mechanisms, the project should enhance the field efficacy of most promising bio-effectors and develop more environmentally friendly practices for alternative plant nutrition strategies. Bio-effectors might contain living microorganisms and active natural compounds, such as soil - and non-soil - bacteria and fungi, microbial residues, plant extracts and exudates, compost extracts, products of biological turnover processes and others, as single ingredient or in mixed formulations. The project should include an adequate plan for field demonstration trials to test the efficacy of the new products in real production conditions and in different geographical situations.

However, many environmental exposure-health associations remain uncertain due to lack of exploitation and integration of data and of global view on population exposures including critical periods of exposure such as foetal and child development.

The overall objective of the topic is to increase the competitiveness of European viticulture through the following actions: (1) improve vineyard agronomic management to ensure better grape quality (grape berry development, ripening, optimisation of time of harvest to retain organoleptic/aroma compounds…) in line with evolving consumer demands; this can lead to optimised production systems for specific grapevine varieties; 2) reinforce agronomic management of plant health issues to improve the sanitary quality of the grape and decrease pesticide application in vineyard and residues in wine; 3) study the adaptation of agronomic practices needed in certain producing areas due to climate change effects; 4) secure technology transfer and best agronomic practices (including guidelines on precision viticulture practices), and their dissemination to farmers and wine making SME's/cooperatives; 5) capitalise on European and international breeding and genomics initiatives to identify new potential for improvement in existing grapevine varieties, and, in a longer term perspective, to contribute to the definition of ideotypes for European grapevine breeding. The project should take into account the different European agro-ecological and climatic conditions, and must acknowledge the pan-European nature (and cultural heritage) of vineyards.</p>"@en ;
